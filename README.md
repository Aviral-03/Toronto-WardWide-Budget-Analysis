# Who Gets What: How Population and Income Shape Toronto’s Budget Decisions

## Overview

This study investigates how population density and average household income affect budget allocations across Toronto’s 25 wards. Using data from the city's 2023-2032 Capital Budget Plan and 2021 Ward Profiles, we analyze spending patterns in key areas like health and safety, infrastructure, and community services. Our findings reveal that higher population densities do not guarantee proportionally greater investments in essential services, while wealthier wards often receive larger capital expenditures. These insights highlight potential disparities in resource distribution, emphasizing the need for more equitable urban budget planning to address diverse community needs.
