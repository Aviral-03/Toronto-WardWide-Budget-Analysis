I want two plot one with average_household_income fill and another with population

Generated by ChatGPT-4o.

To create two separate plots in `ggplot2`, one with `average_household_income` and the other with `population`, you can follow this approach. Since you're using spatial data (`geom_sf()`), you'll want to create two separate `ggplot` objects, each with a different fill aesthetic, and then arrange them using the `patchwork` library (or another method such as `gridExtra`).

Here's the updated code with two plots:

### Step 1: Ensure you have the necessary libraries
Make sure you have installed and loaded `ggplot2` and `patchwork`:

```r
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("patchwork")  # For combining plots

library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
```

### Step 2: Define color scales (optional)
You can define a `color_scale` to customize the color palette:

```r
color_scale <- scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "plasma")  # Example scale
```

### Step 3: Create the two plots

```r
# Plot with average_household_income fill
plot_income <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = toronto_map, aes(fill = average_household_income)) +
  color_scale +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Toronto Map: Average Household Income",
       fill = "Avg. Income") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# Plot with population fill
plot_population <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = toronto_map, aes(fill = population)) +
  color_scale +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Toronto Map: Population",
       fill = "Population") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# Combine the two plots
plot_income / plot_population
```

### Explanation:
- **`plot_income`:** This plot uses `average_household_income` as the fill.
- **`plot_population`:** This plot uses `population` as the fill.
- **`patchwork` (`/` operator):** This is used to arrange the two plots vertically.

create a side-by-side subplots one for average_household_income and other for population

Generated by ChatGPT-4o.
You can create side-by-side subplots using `facet_wrap()` or use the `gridExtra` or `patchwork` libraries to arrange two separate plots next to each other. I'll show you how to use the `patchwork` package for this. First, make sure you have installed the `patchwork` package:

```r
install.packages("patchwork")
```

Then you can create the side-by-side plots as follows:

```r
library(patchwork)

# Plot for Average Household Income by Ward
plot1 <- combined_data |>
  filter(category == "Growth Related") |>
  select(ward_id, average_household_income, total_10_year) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = average_household_income, y = total_10_year, label = ward_id)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(hjust=-0.5, vjust=0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "blue", se = TRUE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Average Household Income vs Total 10-Year Budget",
       x = "Average Household Income",
       y = "Total 10-Year Budget (in 000s)")

# Plot for Population by Ward
plot2 <- combined_data |>
  filter(category == "Growth Related") |>
  select(ward_id, population, total_10_year) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = population, y = total_10_year, label = ward_id)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(hjust=-0.5, vjust=0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "blue", se = TRUE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Population vs Total 10-Year Budget",
       x = "Population",
       y = "Total 10-Year Budget (in 000s)")

# Combine the two plots side by side
plot1 + plot2
```

This will generate side-by-side subplots: one showing the relationship between average household income and the total 10-year budget, and the other showing the relationship between population and the total 10-year budget.

Our research question and estimand is to understand the relationship between the impact of demographic and economic factors on the budget allocation for various categories in Toronto's 25 wards. The primary variables of interest are: population, and average household income to represent these factors. Population is a key demographic indicator as it reflects the number of residents in each ward, while average household income is a measure of economic well-being. Population density can influence the demand for services and infrastructure, while average household income is a critical factor in determining the quality of life, access to resources, and overall economic health of a community.

The budget allocation for different categories, such as Health and Safety, Growth Related, State of Good Repair, and Service Improvement and Enhancement, are the dependent variables that we aim to analyze.

fix this text to highlight the estimand and estimator. Focus on variables of interest and its realtion to the research question that we aim to analysze and study

Our research question and estimand focus on analyzing the relationship between key demographic and economic factors—specifically, population and average household income—and the budget allocation across various categories in Toronto's 25 wards. Population serves as a critical demographic indicator, representing the number of residents in each ward, while average household income reflects economic well-being, influencing access to resources and quality of life. Our primary aim is to estimate the impact of these variables on budget allocations for different categories, including Health and Safety, Growth-Related expenditures, State of Good Repair, and Service Improvement and Enhancement.

Population density is expected to affect the demand for services and infrastructure, while average household income may shape how resources are distributed across wards, reflecting broader economic disparities. The estimand is the causal effect of these factors on the allocation of funds, and the estimator will quantify how shifts in population and income levels influence budgetary decisions. By understanding this relationship, we aim to offer insights into how demographic and economic variables drive municipal spending patterns in different categories across the city.
